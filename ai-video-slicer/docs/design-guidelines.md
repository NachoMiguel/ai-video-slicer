## Visual Style

* **Dark mode by default**, with toggle for light mode
* Minimalist, modern editor-like look (Descript/Figma inspired)
* Neutral color palette: charcoal, gray, soft blue/purple accents
* Rounded corners, soft drop shadows for cards and buttons

## Fonts

* Sans-serif, clean and readable (e.g., Inter or DM Sans)
* Consistent font sizing hierarchy:

  * H1: 2xl
  * H2: xl
  * Base text: md

## Spacing and Layout

* Generous padding for readability
* Grid layout with two main panels:

  * Left: Script Panel
  * Right: Video Panel
* Large upload/drop zones with iconography

## Page Layout Principles

* Script Panel (YouTube URL + prompt controls)
* Video Panel (uploads + YouTube input + preview)
* Final video preview in modal or footer area

## Accessibility and Responsiveness

* Desktop-only design
* Keyboard-friendly navigation
* Sufficient contrast ratios in both dark/light mode

## Brand Tone / Voice Considerations

* Professional but creative
* UX copy should feel like it's speaking to an experienced editor
* Labels and buttons should be short, functional, and to the point

  * Example: “Rewrite Script”, “Generate Video”, “Upload Clips”
