## User Guide: Interactive Script Building Prompts (LEGACY - BULLET POINT APPROACH)

**Note: The following section contains the legacy bullet-point approach. The new system uses full script generation above for better coherence and flow.**

### YouTube Analysis Prompts

When using the YouTube entry method, these prompts help analyze transcripts and create engaging bullet points:

#### Basic YouTube Content Analysis
```
I'm learning YouTube automation, and I need your help creating high-retention scripts that keep viewers interested and clicking. I want the scripts to have a natural flow and avoid anything that feels repetitive, robotic, or slow. Here's how we'll do it i will send you the video transcript of one of my competitors:

1. Research First and Bullet Point Structure
Start by researching the main topic or artist. Look for the key facts but also any recent rumors, controversies, or speculations that have come up in the last few years—these elements often drive more engagement in videos.
Give me bullet points first with the structure you plan to use, so I can check that everything flows naturally.
As you create bullet points and write the script, keep these six things in mind:
Make each section introduce something new and interesting.
Avoid repetitive or robotic phrases; aim for smooth flow.
Write each sentence with the viewer in mind, keeping it clear, engaging, and moving quickly.
2. Script Structure and Flow
Introduction: Open with a bold statement or question that immediately pulls viewers in without giving away too much.
Sections: Break the story into 6-8 sections, each adding new information and keeping the pace fast. Avoid starting each chapter with a repeated intro or reference to the title—just dive straight into the new information.
Conclusion: Summarize the video's main points with a thought-provoking or surprising note, encouraging viewers to think about the topic beyond the video.
Format: Write the script in paragraph form with no "movie director" language. Avoid phrases like "[Cut to shot of...]" or stage directions, and write as though it's a story told in a straightforward, engaging way.
3. Tone and Style
Keep the tone engaging, slightly mysterious, and conversational. Imagine you're sharing an exciting story with a friend.
Use direct, concise language to keep the viewer interested. Avoid filler and repeated phrasing.
Make each section feel like a quick, interesting piece of information that builds curiosity.
4. Techniques for High Retention
Start each section with a hook that grabs attention without repeating information from earlier.
Add brief transitions at the end of each section to hint at what's coming next. Keep these concise and impactful to maintain pacing, with phrases like "But that wasn't the whole story..." or "And what happened next would shock everyone..."
Keep sentences short and impactful, with no long-winded or complex explanations.
5. Topics and Themes
Focus on controversial, shocking, or unknown elements of the subject's life or career.
Incorporate recent rumors, controversies, and speculations whenever possible to keep content fresh.
Highlight the subject's challenges, untold stories, or conflicts that viewers may not know.
6. Phrasing, Dramatic Language, and Censorship
Use powerful, engaging language, like "shocking," "exposed," or "revealed," to hold the viewer's attention.
Censor or reword sensitive topics to ensure compliance with YouTube's guidelines:
Avoid direct language for terms like "suicide," "overdose," or "criminal accusations."
Use indirect phrasing (e.g., "off'd himself" for "suicide," "O.D'd" for "overdose," "accusations surfaced" for legal issues).
Ensure any profanity is censored, e.g., "dmn" or "sht."
Don't repeat introductions or start each section with references to the title—just get straight to the point.
7. Varied Wording for Key Phrases
Avoid overusing specific phrases or descriptions (e.g., "shocking truth" or "exposed"). Instead, vary the language to keep the script fresh and engaging.
This ensures the script flows naturally and avoids a formulaic tone.
8. Your Tasks
Do research on the topic and summarize your findings in bullet points, showing the planned structure of the script.
Write the Full Script: Use the structure and tone above to create an engaging script in paragraph form, double-checking for natural flow and avoiding repetition.
Smooth Transitions: Each section should lead naturally to the next, keeping viewers interested.
Refine Tone: Keep it human and conversational, ensuring each part feels relatable and engaging without any repetition.
Focus on length to make it long enough to form 20000-30000 letters
